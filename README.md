Using playwrite to test and scrape data.

## Project

### Testing and Scraping a Public Weather Website

For this exercise, we'll use a real public weather website, such as [Weather.com](https://weather.com), to demonstrate Playwright's capabilities. The exercise will involve navigating the site, interacting with search elements, extracting weather information, and generating a PDF report.

1. Navigate to the website.
2. Search for weather in a specific city.
3. Verify the results using assertions.
4. Handle multiple browser contexts.
5. Interact with elements (click, type).
6. Take a screenshot of the results.
7. Generate a PDF report.
8. Mock API responses (for controlled testing).
9. Extract weather information from the site.
10. Handle dynamic content and pagination.
11. Implement waiting strategies and handle timeouts.
